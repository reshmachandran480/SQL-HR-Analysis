### SQL-Based Analysis of a Human Resources Database

#### Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a sample Human Resources (HR) database. Its purpose is to answer critical business questions by querying the data, demonstrating a strong proficiency in SQL. The analysis covers various aspects of HR data, including employee demographics, salary distribution, departmental structure, and employee tenure.

This repository serves as a portfolio piece showcasing the ability to write clean, efficient, and complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from relational data.

#### Database Schema
The database consists of four interconnected tables that model a typical HR system.
- **`employees`**: The central table containing detailed information for each employee.
- **`departments`**: Contains information on all company departments.
- **`locations`**: Stores the physical location details for each office.
- **`emp_payment`**: A historical log of salary payments.
